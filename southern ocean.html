       <font color="red"><em> <h1><u>Southern Ocean</u></h1></em></font>The Southern Ocean, also known as the Antarctic Ocean,[1][note 4] comprises the southernmost waters of the World Ocean
           generally taken to be south of 60° S latitude and encircling Antarctica.[4] As such,
            it is regarded as the second-smallest of the five principal oceanic divisions: smaller than the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian oceans but larger than the Arctic Ocean.[5] Over the past 30 years, the Southern Ocean has been subject to rapid climate change, which has led to changes in the marine ecosystem.[6]
        By way of his voyages in the 1770s, James Cook proved that waters encompassed the southern latitudes of the globe.
         Since then, geographers have disagreed on the Southern Ocean's northern boundary or even existence,
          considering the waters as various parts of the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans, instead. However, according to Commodore John Leech of the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO),
            recent oceanographic research has discovered the importance of Southern Circulation,and the term Southern Ocean has been used to define the body of water which lies south of the northern limit of that circulation.
             [7] This remains the current official policy of the IHO,  since a 2000 revision of its definitions including the Southern Ocean as the waters south of the 60th parallel has not yet been adopted. 
             Others regard the seasonally-fluctuating Antarctic Convergence as the natural boundary.
             [8] This oceanic zone is where cold, northward flowing waters from the Antarctic mix with warmer Subantarctic waters.
        The maximum depth of the Southern Ocean, using the definition that it lies south of 60th parallel, was surveyed by the Five Deeps Expedition in early February 2019.
         The expedition's multibeam sonar team identified the deepest point at 60° 28' 46"S, 025° 32' 32"W, with a depth of 7,434 metres (24,390 ft).
          The expedition leader and chief submersible pilot Victor Vescovo, has proposed naming this deepest point in the Southern Ocean the "Factorian Deep", based on the name of the manned submersible DSV Limiting Factor,
           in which he successfully visited the bottom for the first time on February 3, 2019.[9]
